# Rock Paper Scissors Project



### What is the purpose of this project? 

1. We aim to utilise the mediapipe and opencv libraries to learn the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques. 
2. In the day and age where tracking and facial recognition is common, it is important that we as programmers understand the fundamentals of this sector. 
3. Mediapie is an open-source framework from Google for the fabrication of pipelines to perform computer vision inference over arbitrary sensory data such as video or audio. 
4. In contrast opencv (open source computer vision library) is the essential toolkit for anyone working with computer vision and machine learning. As an open-source libray, this means that the mediapipe framework which Google accesses, initially derived off from the opencv library. 



--- Steps for Setup ---

1. Create a virtual environment with python3.10 or slightly below. 

```
pip install opencv-contrib-python

```
pip install mediapipe

And utilise the following libraries: 

import random 
import time 
from datetime import datetime
