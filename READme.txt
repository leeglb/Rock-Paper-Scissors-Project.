The following project folder contains files for the following projects:


1. RPS.py --> Rock Paper Scissors (Using mediapipe & opencv)
2. Alarm-System.py --> Alarm System 


This project folder is to learn the capabilities and experiment with both facial, body and finger tracking.
Ultimately, whilst this is quite the beginner friendly coding, it is a great experience 
and fun project series.
